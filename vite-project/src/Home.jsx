            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>You will be taken to our actual digital map webpage by clicking on 
               this interactive map model. Our interactive digital map will allow 
               you to check on the safety level of various neighborhoods. You can 
               simply click on the specific area you want to discover, which displays 
               all the information you want to know, including any housing option. 
               Our safety level is averagely summed up into 1 to 5 stars(1 extremely 
               dangerous and 5 very safe). This level is fixable according to the 
               crime history.
