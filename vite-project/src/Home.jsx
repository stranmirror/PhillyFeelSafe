Crime and safety in Mantua have been points of concern, with efforts to combat these issues ongoing for decades. Community leaders and organizations have worked tirelessly to improve the area, focusing on projects like the establishment of recreation centers that require a library card for entry, signaling a commitment to education and community engagement. Despite these efforts, the neighborhood has faced challenges related to gang violence and drug-related crime, particularly during the rise of crack cocaine and heroin markets in the 1980s. This led to significant population shifts and changes in the local economy, with many residents moving away and local businesses being replaced by smaller convenience stores​​

It features a mix of small to large townhomes and apartment complexes, with a significant portion of the population commuting by bicycle, on foot, or by train. The area is notable for its cultural diversity and a high proportion of residents with advanced degrees.
