My name is Weihao Li, and I am majoring in Cyber Security and Information 
Technology for a Bachelor's Degree(BSCST). I aim to use my academic training
and knowledge with a passion for technology to obtain a relative career 
position. I also look forward to improving my skills in this field by doing 
hands-on experiences.
